Depends on `pipelinehelpers` package. Do:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("kaggle/pipelinehelpers")
```

This example shows how to use either `Make` or [`Snakemake`](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake/wiki/Home) as a build system. (You don't need to look at both `Snakefile` and `Makefile`. They're redundant.)

Thanks to [dkoppstein](https://github.com/dkoppstein) for adding the `Snakefile`.

I'd love for this to turn into an example demonstrating many more build tools too!
